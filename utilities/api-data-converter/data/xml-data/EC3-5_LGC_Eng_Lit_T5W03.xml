          <rac_body-text>To help children understand the idea of moving carefully through their surroundings, set up an obstacle course. Ask children to pretend that each of the obstacles is a person, and they have to walk around the people without touching or bumping into them. It might be fun to do this to music, if available. Depending on the group, you may want the children to take turns, choose a few at a time to walk, or have the whole group move at once. You may also determine the speed at which the children move.</rac_body-text>

        <rac_child_development_body>Preschoolers may not have developed much impulse control. When they feel something, they are likely to act on it. This may include snatching a toy away from another child if they want to play with it or getting upset when told they need to wait. Encourage children to respect one another’s boundaries and to be patient. (Kochanska, 2000.)</rac_child_development_body>
