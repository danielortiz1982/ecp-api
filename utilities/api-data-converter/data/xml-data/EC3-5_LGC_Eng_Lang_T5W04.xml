        <rac_child_development_body>When words in different languages share similar spelling and meaning, they are cognates. Spanish and English share many cognates; pointing them out can help English learners in the classroom. The English word dinosaur has the Spanish cognate dinosaurio.

Choose one child and whisper a simple emotion into his or her ear, such as angry, happy, or sad. That child goes into the circle and tries to show that emotion with his or her face and body. Let other children take turns guessing the emotion. Once a child has guessed it correctly, that child takes the next turn acting out an emotion.  </rac_body-text>

        <rac_child_development_body>Showing empathy is a skill that can be developed like many others. Children need to be able to identify others’ emotions and then imagine feeling that way themselves. They should also think about what they can do to help, and what they would want and need if they felt the same way. Discussing pictures and stories can help them develop these skills.
