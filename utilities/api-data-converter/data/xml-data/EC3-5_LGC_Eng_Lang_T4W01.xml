        <rac_child_development_body>Focusing one’s attention is a basic executive function skill that children need to develop in order to begin learning. Children must work through several steps to successfully pay attention: 1) be alert, 2) select what to pay attention to and sustain that attention even with outside distractions, and 3) if distracted, shift focus back to task.
