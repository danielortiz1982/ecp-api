        <rac_child_development_body>Reframing the narrative in order to empower or motivate oneself is an important skill in the emotional development of children. Adults can model for children how to see a situation in a new and positive way (i.e., “You’re not first in line, but you get to stand next to your friend!”) in order to help them internalize this behavior.

        <rac_child_development_body>Once children are familiar with the one-to-one correspondence of numbers, they will be able to look at small groups of objects, and understand intuitively what, for example, “three” looks like without having to count one-two-three. Practicing this skill will increase a child’s confidence in counting to higher numbers as well as addition.</rac_child_development_body>
