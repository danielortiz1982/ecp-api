        <rac_child_development_body>Knowing ordinal terms (<rac_body-text_emphasis>first, second, third,</rac_body-text_emphasis> etc.) allows children to understand and to communicate the orders or placements of people or things. The ordinals “first,” “second,” and “third” are different from the cardinal numbers “one,” “two,” and “three,” so children often need to learn and practice these terms separately.</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Using spatial language to describe position and location (i.e., <rac_body-text_emphasis>near, under, over</rac_body-text_emphasis>) helps children better describe their environment and encourages spatial problem-solving.
