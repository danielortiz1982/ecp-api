          <ac_teacher-card-body>In Spanish, the letter <ac_teacher-talk>g </ac_teacher-talk>has a hard /g/ sound when it is followed by the vowels <ac_teacher-talk>a, o, </ac_teacher-talk>and <ac_teacher-talk>u: gato, gordo, gusta.</ac_teacher-talk> When it is followed by the vowels <ac_teacher-talk>i</ac_teacher-talk> and <ac_teacher-talk>e, </ac_teacher-talk>it is soft, making the /h/ sound: <ac_teacher-talk>gimnasio, general</ac_teacher-talk>. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>In Spanish, the letter <ac_teacher-talk>h</ac_teacher-talk> is always silent. You might try to pretend it is invisible, too, when you see words with <ac_teacher-talk>h</ac_teacher-talk>’<ac_teacher-talk>s</ac_teacher-talk>. For example, the verb <ac_teacher-talk>hay</ac_teacher-talk> is pronounced like the English word <ac_teacher-talk>eye</ac_teacher-talk>. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>If children are unable to sculpt with clay, allow them to use a medium more accessible to their abilities. For example, you may provide a long paintbrush and an easel for children who have trouble making or manipulating small objects. </ac_teacher-card-body>

Then, without talking, you will act like the helper on your card. The rest of us will guess which helper you are pretending to be!</ac_teacher-speaking> </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children may be familiar with the words in their home languages that name these helpers. Encourage children to share the words with the group. Help children decide what they will do to act out what the helpers do before you call on them. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Some children may not be able to act out a role due to struggles with gross motor skill development or disabilities. In this case, modify the activity by allowing children to say clue words—but not the actual name of the helper—rather than acting out the role. Assist with clues as needed. </ac_teacher-card-body>
