        <rac_child_development_body>When children explore the world around them, they begin to develop their observational skills. When children ask “why” animals behave in certain ways, they are building curiosity and strengthening their learning. Teaching children about animals is an opportunity to let them become cognizant learners and beginner behaviorists.</rac_child_development_body>
