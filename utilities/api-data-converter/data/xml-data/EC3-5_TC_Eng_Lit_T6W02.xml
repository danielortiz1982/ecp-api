              <ac_teacher-speaking> Let’s pretend we are the farm animals and say these rhyming pairs. I’ll say them first, and then you repeat them. </ac_teacher-speaking>Turn over the pairs of rhyming words, one pair at a time, and say them:<ac_teacher-talk>	goat, coat, duck, truck, chick, stick, cat, hat, dog, </ac_teacher-talk>and<ac_teacher-talk> log</ac_teacher-talk>. Illustrate each word with a simple outline and say each word again.    </ac_teacher-card-body>
