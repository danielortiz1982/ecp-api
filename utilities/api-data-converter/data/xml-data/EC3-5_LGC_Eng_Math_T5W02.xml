        <rac_child_development_body>Understanding that large words can be broken down into smaller parts, or syllables, can make it easier for children to learn how to read and write. One way to find syllables in words is by clapping. Say <rac_body-text_emphasis>market</rac_body-text_emphasis> with the children, and clap on each syllable. Challenge students to count the syllables in <rac_body-text_emphasis>banana</rac_body-text_emphasis>.</rac_child_development_body>

If children struggle to notice how other people feel, it can help to use concrete terms to describe feelings, act out feelings, and provide positive feedback when children are successful at noticing feelings.
