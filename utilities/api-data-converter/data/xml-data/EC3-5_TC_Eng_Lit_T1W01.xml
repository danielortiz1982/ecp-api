When each child is finished say: <ac_teacher-speaking>Who can guess what  <fill-in-the-blank>      </fill-in-the-blank> likes to do? </ac_teacher-speaking></ac_teacher-card-body>
            <ac_teacher-card-body>Call on children to guess. The first person who guesses correctly gets the next turn to act out what she or he likes to do.  </ac_teacher-card-body>
            <ac_teacher-card-body>Finally, recall what the children did and have children clap if they like to do the same thing. For example say: “Roberto likes to fly a kite. Clap if you like to do that, too.”  </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children may be able to guess what the child is acting out, but not be able to communicate it. Help a child by giving him the language he needs or by giving a starter sentence to complete, such as “I think <fill-in-the-blank>    </fill-in-the-blank> likes to <fill-in-the-blank>    </fill-in-the-blank>.”</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage gross motor development by inviting children to act out the activities they like to do outdoors. Prompt children by saying, “What do you like to do in the playground? In the park?” Friends work together to guess the activity.</ac_teacher-card-body>
