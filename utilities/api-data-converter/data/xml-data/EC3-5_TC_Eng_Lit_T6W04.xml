Have the child use the mirror to make his or her face have the same expression. If possible, display the mirror in the classroom so that children can have fun practicing making and identifying emotions with friends. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Extended conversation plays a critical role in helping multilingual learners to acquire a new language. One way to support children is by using oral conversation frames that repeat part of the question in the answer. For example: <ac_teacher-speaking>What is one safety rule? One safety rule is “no running.”</ac_teacher-speaking> Have children say the frames with you. Then have partners use the frames to ask and answer questions with each other.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Attention Support</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Many preschool-age children have trouble maintaining attention through an extended conversation. Use a “talking turn” object such as a rock, ball, or stuffed animal. Only the child with the object can speak. When the child is done, the object is handed to the next child. For children who like to move, this can be made into an active game. Use a ball and allow the child to roll it to the next speaker.  </ac_teacher-card-body>
