        <rac_child_development_body>It’s easy to monitor the physical development of children at this age, as we see them getting taller, bigger, and stronger before our eyes. It takes more work to assess their social-emotional development, but it’s important to do so. Take special note of children’s understanding of feelings, both in themselves and in others.</rac_child_development_body>
