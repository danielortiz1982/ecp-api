As you read aloud a book’s title and the names of the creator(s), run your finger below each word. While reading a story, ask children to identify key words depicted in the illustrations.</rac_child_development_body>

They can understand more spoken language than they can use for expressing themselves. Multilanguage learners can benefit from the Day 5 story prompts, which invite children to act out parts of a story instead of asking for a verbal response.</rac_child_development_body>
