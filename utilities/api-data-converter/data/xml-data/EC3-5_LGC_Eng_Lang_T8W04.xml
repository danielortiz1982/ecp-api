        <rac_child_development_body>Research has shown that pretend play is a vital component of social and cognitive growth in the preK years. Pretend play helps to expand children’s vocabulary, language, and creativity. Role playing also improves social skills, including communication, problem solving, empathy, and the ability to share another’s perspective.</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>You can help children learn to persist by providing lots of activities that involve solving problems with more than one solution. Support children’s independence, and resist the urge to fix a problem so that children see that they can solve the problem independently. Provide gentle guidance if frustration sets in.
