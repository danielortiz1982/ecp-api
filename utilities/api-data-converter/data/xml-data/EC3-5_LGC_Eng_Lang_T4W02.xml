        <rac_child_development_body>Children’s understanding of what they can do is an important part of their emotional development because it indicates that they have a growing self-awareness. When children begin to feel and express pride about what they can do, it helps them to feel more positive about themselves. (Morgan, 2015).  </rac_child_development_body>
