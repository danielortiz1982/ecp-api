          <ac_teacher-card-body>Provide clay, craft sticks, pipe cleaners, paper, and Connecting Cubes so that children can build their own creations out of the materials you provide. Children can also choose to draw their creations. Encourage children to use as many describing words as possible when they talk about their creations and the materials they used to build them. </ac_teacher-card-body>
