To teach persistence, compliment effort and hard work with comments such as, “I can see you worked hard on this,” or “I’m glad you didn’t give up!” (Zimmerman, 1981.)</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Before children learn that groups of letters form words, they can become familiar with print concepts. These basic principles introduce children to the idea that written words have meaning. Children must understand this before they can learn any other literacy skills. As you reread the book, point out to children the page numbers and pictures. Point out that on every page you are reading left to right, from the top of the page to the bottom. </rac_child_development_body>
