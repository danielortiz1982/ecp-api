Then, you will graph your partner’s answer. We’ll compare the group’s answers to discover new things about our friends!</ac_teacher-speaking>

Have partners ask each other a question about their lives, for example: <ac_teacher-speaking>Does your partner have a pet? Investigate by asking your partner!</ac_teacher-speaking> Give all partners time to ask each other the question and discuss their answers.</ac_teacher-card-body>

Does your partner have a pet?</ac_teacher-speaking> Have partners place their partner’s sticky note on the chart to record the answer in the “pet” or “no pet” column. They should place sticky notes with the same answer in a column to create a bar graph.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>This activity requires varied vocabulary, and may be difficult for multilingual learners. Pair children with partners who speak the same home language, if possible. Try to choose questions that play to children’s vocabulary strengths. (For example, if a child knows a lot of vocabulary regarding siblings, but not as much regarding pets, ask instead, <ac_teacher-speaking>Do you have a brother or sister?</ac_teacher-speaking>).</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Rather than having children place sticky notes on a chart, have them create each graph by placing Two-Color Counters on the table or floor in straight rows. When one graph is finished, discuss what new information was discovered before moving on to the next question, using the same counters to record answers.</ac_teacher-card-body>
