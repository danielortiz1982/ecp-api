          <ac_teacher-card-body>Learning is transferable across languages. So, if children learn the principles of motion, pushing, and pulling in one language, they will easily transfer that learning to another language. Therefore, if children prefer to do this activity in their home language with other children who share the same home language, what they discover and learn about movement will easily transfer to English. It is just a matter of learning new labels or words to express the same concepts.</ac_teacher-card-body>

Can people help?  </ac_teacher-card-body>
