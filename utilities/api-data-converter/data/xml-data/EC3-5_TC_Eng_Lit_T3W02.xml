          <ac_teacher-card-body>By depicting all three cloud types on one sheet of paper, children can learn the typical position of each cloud in the sky. Some children may find it easier to use an entire sheet of paper for each cloud type. If so, display cirrus on top, cumulus in the middle, stratus on bottom.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Science vocabulary is most likely new to most children, so English and non-English speakers are starting from the same place. In this lesson, sit multilingual and English learners next to each other to encourage conversation using the new vocabulary—stratus, cirrus, cumulus clouds.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who have difficulty pronouncing the different sounds in multi-syllable words, say each cloud name syllable by syllable. Have children repeat after you. For example, say <ac_teacher-speaking>“cu” “mu” “lus”; “stra” “tus”; </ac_teacher-speaking>and <ac_teacher-speaking>“cir” “rus.”</ac_teacher-speaking> Make sure children are able to see you. Point to your mouth as you enunciate each syllable.</ac_teacher-card-body>
