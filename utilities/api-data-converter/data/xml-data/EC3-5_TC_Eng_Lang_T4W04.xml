          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to use a physical response in addition to speaking. For example, invite children to wiggle their fingers near their faces if an animal has whiskers, or cup their hands around their eyes if an animal has big eyes. These physical and visual cues will support language learners and help them participate in the activity even as their language skills develop.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider playing this activity in the large-group space or outdoors where children can move their bodies like each animal would. This activity will give them the opportunity to jump and leap like big cats, swim like seals or sharks, etc. Big body play encourages engagement, activates memory, and helps develop children’s strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>
