The girl put on her sneakers so that her feet would be comfortable. Then, she put on her hat to help keep the sun out of her eyes. And then she filled her water bottle so that she would not be thirsty on the hike. She wanted to have everything ready.</ac_teacher-speaking> </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>While there will be a range of “normal,” children’s speech at age three should be understood by a stranger about 75% of the time, at age four 75–95% of the time, and at age five 95% of the time. Provide safe opportunities for children to express themselves and use oral language. For many children, repetition can be a non-threatening way to practice using complete sentences.</ac_teacher-card-body>

One conversation strategy is to restate what a child has said and then immediately ask: <ac_teacher-speaking>Is that what you meant?</ac_teacher-speaking>  By restating what a child has said, you validate their contributions, make sure that you understood the child correctly, and model correct language. Children will listen more closely to their classmates if they know that you may ask for volunteers to restate what the classmate just said.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>The foods we eat form a big part of our cultural heritage. There are differences across cultures in ingredients, preparation, and preservation of foods. Different cultures eat different foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Showing an interest in and appreciation for the foods that a child eats at home is a way of valuing that child’s culture. Arrange an International Day or Pot Luck where families can bring their favorite dishes to share with the class. Show your personal appreciation for each food by tasting each food and showing that you think it’s tasty. Your children will notice.</ac_teacher-card-body>
