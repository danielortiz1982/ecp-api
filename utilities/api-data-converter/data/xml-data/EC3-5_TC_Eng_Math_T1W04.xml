            <ac_teacher-card-body>Have children count aloud the number of cubes in their superheroes.</ac_teacher-card-body>
            <ac_teacher-card-body>
              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Extend</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Emphasize that each child’s superhero has the same number of cubes, even though they are very different. <ac_teacher-speaking>Each of your superheroes are amazing and special! But each one was made with the same number of cubes.</ac_teacher-speaking>

              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Repeat</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Have children create a different superhero using the same 10 cubes. Have children count the cubes used in the new superhero. Emphasize that the number of cubes stays the same, no matter how children arrange them.</ac_teacher-card-body>

But each of you needed to build with 10 cubes. You shared the cubes with your friends. Why is it important that we share our cubes as a class?</ac_teacher-speaking>
