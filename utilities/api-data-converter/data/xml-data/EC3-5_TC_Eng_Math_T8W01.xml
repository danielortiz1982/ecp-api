          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who need more language support, frequently practice counting aloud with the class. Children may first memorize the number sequence 1 to 5, and then connect the words to their meaning. Use the number words frequently during class time for increased practice.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Placing small objects onto the 5-frame requires dexterity. Frames can be enlarged for children who may have less precise fine motor skills. A fun modification for the game to support all learners with fine motor skills is to use tongs or tweezers to pick up objects and place them on the frame.</ac_teacher-card-body>
