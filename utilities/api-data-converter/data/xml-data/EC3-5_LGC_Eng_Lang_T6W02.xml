To get children involved, practice before you read, give children a focus, and ask guided, open-ended questions like “Why did we growl loudly as we read along?”</rac_child_development_body>

After children sing, dance, or perform, have them review the order in which they sang the song or performed the dance. Use open-ended questions to find out why.
