            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>One day, a small caterpillar was out looking for excitement. She came to Rabbit’s house and had an idea. <flip_chart-bold>Caterpillar crawled into Rabbit’s house.</flip_chart-bold>
            </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph> <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Rabbit came home.

I have 12 eyes to find you with and 6 legs to chase you with and a hungry mouth that bites!” the voice boomed.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
              <flip_chart-bold>Rabbit trembled in fear.</flip_chart-bold> “What can a little creature like me do in the face of The Long Furry One?” he gasped.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Rabbit ran to Leopard. “There is a monster in my house,” he cried. “Help me!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Leopard was not afraid.

              <flip_chart-bold>Leopard trembled in fear.</flip_chart-bold> “Twelve eyes is too many!” she said. “Go get Rhinoceros!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Rabbit ran to Rhinoceros. “Help me!” he cried. “There is a monster in my house.”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Rhinoceros was not afraid.

              <flip_chart-bold>Rhinoceros trembled in fear.</flip_chart-bold> “Six legs?” he asked. “That’s even more than I have! Rabbit, there is a real monster in your house. You have to move!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Just then, a little frog hopped by. Rabbit told Frog all about the monster in his house.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
              <flip_chart-bold>“I can help!” said Frog.</flip_chart-bold>  </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The bigger animals laughed. But Frog put his head inside Rabbit’s house.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“I am The Green Slimy One,” Frog’s voice boomed. “My tongue is almost as long as I am.

              <flip_chart-bold>Caterpillar crawled out.</flip_chart-bold></flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
