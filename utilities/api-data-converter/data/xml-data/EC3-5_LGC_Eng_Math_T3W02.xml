        <rac_child_development_body>Encourage children to think of the next number in a counting sequence as “one more,” and the previous number as “one less.” By implementing rational counting rather than rote counting, children begin to see that counting up is the same as adding one more, and counting down is the same as removing one – an important operations skill. </rac_child_development_body>

          <rac_teacher-talk_blue>Everyone has needs. A need is something that is very important to life, like having food to eat and water to drink. A need can also be your need to go to the bathroom! It’s important to know what you need, and to be able to tell others in a way that is polite and kind. Often, other people are the ones who can help make sure your needs are taken care of.</rac_teacher-talk_blue> <rac_child_development_icon> </rac_child_development_icon>
