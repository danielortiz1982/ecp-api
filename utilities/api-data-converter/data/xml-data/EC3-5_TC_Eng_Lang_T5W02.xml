          <ac_teacher-card-body>Model and encourage children to use a physical response, in addition to speaking, to talk about what the farmers are doing in the pictures. For example, they use their hands to do a digging motion, or pretending to gather eggs one at a time to put them in a basket.  </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Support Conversation Skills </ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage a conversation about the different foods and how they are made. One conversation strategy is to restate what a child has said and then immediately ask: Is that what you meant?  By restating what a child has said, you validate their contributions, make sure that you understood the child correctly, and model correct language. Eventually, you can have children restate what their classmates have said using the same method of asking directly: Is that what you meant? Children will listen more closely to their classmates if they know that you may ask for volunteers to restate what the classmate just said.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Multilingual Learners </ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage multilingual learners to share the names of all the foods in their home languages. If children are shy about speaking their home language, learn the names yourself, and ask students to point to that food. Children whose first language is Spanish may recognize the Spanish cognates <ac_teacher-talk>fruta, planta, papaya,</ac_teacher-talk> and <ac_teacher-talk>brócoli</ac_teacher-talk>. Help children make these connections, freeing their minds for the important executive function skill of classifying and organizing. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Support Conversation Skills </ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage a conversation about the features of different foods. One conversation strategy is to restate what a child says and then immediately ask: <ac_teacher-speaking>Is that what you meant?</ac_teacher-speaking> By restating what a child has said, you validate their contributions. Eventually, you can have children restate what their classmates have said using the same method.</ac_teacher-card-body>
