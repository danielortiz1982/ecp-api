        <rac_child_development_body>Rote counting is the base skill of all math concepts. Before you can add or subtract, you must know what the numbers are! Practice is key, especially for the teen numbers, as they do not follow the common pattern of number names (<rac_body-text_emphasis>seven-teen</rac_body-text_emphasis>, rather than <rac_body-text_emphasis>ten-seven</rac_body-text_emphasis>). Try to find opportunities to practice numbers 10–20 as often as you can.</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>It is crucial for young children to develop an “environment of relationships.” Positive peer-to-peer and adult-to-child interactions lay the foundation for both academic success and mental health. Start by helping children refer to each other and you by name, and notice each other’s defining traits and features. Point out when someone is absent. (NSCDC, 2004)</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>One important principle of counting is that the order that items are counted in is irrelevant. Help children understand that objects can be counted left-to-right, right-to-left, or randomly and that the same number will be reached, as long as every object in the set is given one count. Seeing this in practice reinforces the concept.</rac_child_development_body>
