            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Once upon a time, there were three little rabbits who wanted to build their own houses. Mama Rabbit said, “Make sure to build strong houses that will keep you safe and warm.” The little rabbits waved good-bye to Mama Rabbit and went to build their houses. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Ryan Rabbit collected some straw. Then he piled up the straw. <flip_chart-bold>Ryan Rabbit made a house of straw.</flip_chart-bold> He added a brown door. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Ricardo Rabbit gathered some sticks. He stacked them on top of each other. <flip_chart-bold>Ricardo Rabbit made a house of sticks.</flip_chart-bold> He added a green door.  </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Rebecca Rabbit collected some bricks. <flip_chart-bold>Rebecca Rabbit made a house of bricks.</flip_chart-bold> She made a red roof and a chimney, too! </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Later that day, the big bad wolf came along. He loved to scare little rabbits. Ryan and Ricardo were inside Ryan’s straw house. The wolf said, “Little rabbits! Little rabbits! Let me in! Let me in!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Ryan and Ricardo said, “No! No! No! Not by the fur on our chinny chin chins!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>So the wolf said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your straw house down!” The wolf huffed and he puffed. Then <flip_chart-bold>the wolf blew the straw house down</flip_chart-bold>. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Ryan and Ricardo escaped and ran to Ricardo’s house of sticks. Rebecca Rabbit was there, too.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Then the wolf came to the house of sticks.  “Little rabbits! Little rabbits! Let me in! Let me in!” When they saw the wolf they said, “No! No! No! Not by the fur on our chinny chin chins.”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The wolf answered, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house of sticks down!” The wolf huffed and he puffed. Then <flip_chart-bold>he blew the house of sticks down</flip_chart-bold>. The rabbits escaped and ran to their sister Rebecca’s house of bricks.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The wolf knew the rabbits were inside the house of bricks. “Little rabbits! Little rabbits! Let me in! Let me in!” cried the wolf.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The little rabbits answered, “No! No! No! Not by the fur on our chinny chin chins.” </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The wolf said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house down!” So he huffed and he puffed until he was out of breath. But <flip_chart-bold>he could not blow the brick house down</flip_chart-bold>. So the wolf gave up and ran away. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The next day, Ryan Rabbit and Ricardo Rabbit each built their own house of bricks. The houses were just like Rebecca’s house! Now they were finally safe from the big bad wolf!</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
