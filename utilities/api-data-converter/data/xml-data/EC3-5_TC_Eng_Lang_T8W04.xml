          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children will look at pictures of adventures all around the country. Explain that English speakers can have different words and expressions that refer to the same thing. Sometimes you may not understand a word that someone says even when the word is in your own language. For example, some people use the word <ac_teacher-talk>soda, </ac_teacher-talk>others say <ac_teacher-talk>pop</ac_teacher-talk>. Ask children if they can speak more than one language and what that language is. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Have children act out an adventure in one of the locations shown on the cards. Encourage children to use large body movements to represent, for example, holding the sails of a boat against a strong wind, or climbing a steep path on a mountain trail. Movement helps activate memory as it makes the activity more stimulating.</ac_teacher-card-body>

              <ac_teacher-speaking>In this activity, we will look at pictures of adults doing different jobs. We will figure out what kind of job the person in the picture has, and we’ll talk about what that person does. We’ll also talk about if we think that’s a job that we might like to have one day when we grow up.   </ac_teacher-speaking>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who have fine-motor development difficulties, provide a play space where children can pretend to be an artist or a doctor using tools like a small paintbrush or a stethoscope. Encourage creative play but include the use of pretend or toy tools to represent the motions needed. As children act out the tasks, have them use terms that describe the job and the tools to reinforce the vocabulary.</ac_teacher-card-body>
