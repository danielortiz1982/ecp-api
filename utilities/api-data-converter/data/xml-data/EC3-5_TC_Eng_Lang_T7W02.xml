          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to use a physical response, in addition to speaking. For example, invite children to make a circle in front of themselves with their arms to be a pumpkin or curl their fingers to show blossoms. These physical and verbal cues will support language learners and help them participate as their language skills develop.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider doing this activity in a large-group space or outdoors where children can move their bodies and pretend to be the plants shown in the pictures. They could roll like a pumpkin or stretch like a growing flower. They could jump, reaching toward the sky like a tree, or use their arms and hands like falling leaves. This kind of play supports engagement and memory skills, and helps build coordination.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Give children extra time for peer-to-peer conversations about the seasons. Review with children the names of the seasons in English, using the label cards you made. Then have them work in pairs to put the picture cards in order. Remind children that it’s okay to use all the languages they know when talking to a child who is also multilingual.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Offer children the opportunity to respond to the activity using pencils, crayons, or markers. Be sure to provide colors that will match the trees shown on the cards (white/pink for apple blossoms, red for apples, green for leaves and grass, and so on). Encourage children to draw and use as many describing words as possible.</ac_teacher-card-body>
