          <ac_teacher-card-body>To help children with auditory discrimination challenges, exaggerate the movements of your mouth as you form each letter sound, being mindful of your tongue and lip positions. Do this while saying the sound in isolation and again as you say the sound within the picture word. Invite children to move their mouths in the same way as they make the letter sound.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Have each partner stand on a piece of paper. Draw lines on the paper to mark the heel and toe, and then have the child step away. Use a ruler to draw a straight line from toe to heel. Now students can more easily measure by placing Cubes directly on the straight line. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Learning about measurement introduces all children to new vocabulary. To help multilingual learners, use an online language translator or call on family support, before beginning this lesson. Learn the following measurement terms and phrases in the language of your multilingual learners: <ac_teacher-talk>How long? How many? How big? </ac_teacher-talk>When teaching, use English, followed by their home language, and then English again. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Fine Motor Support</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Connecting Cubes are a great way for children to strengthen their fine motor skills. If the activity is too difficult for some learners, connect cubes in a variety of lengths ahead of time. Children can line up sets of the Connecting Cubes alongside their partner’s foot. Have them try different lengths until they find the one that matches.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>One of the goals of this activity is to engage all learners in the process of scientific inquiry and investigation. Here are a few strategies that teachers can use to help multilingual learners accomplish this: Use actual objects, provide small-group learning with English speakers, and help children engage in hands-on exploration. Learning about measurement introduces all children to new vocabulary. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Sensory Support</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to touch the objects being weighed and observe some of the physical characteristics that make one object heavier than another. For example, a rock is heavier than tissues rolled up into a ball of similar volume. Allow children to explore their ideas and predict the results before they weigh the objects. </ac_teacher-card-body>
