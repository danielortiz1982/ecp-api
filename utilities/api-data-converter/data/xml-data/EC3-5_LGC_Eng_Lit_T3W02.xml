        <rac_child_development_body>Children’s vocabulary is influenced not only by the quantity of words they hear but by the quality of words. By three to four years of age, children are ready to be exposed to more challenging words. For example, saying humongous instead of big or peek instead of look can positively contribute to children’s vocabulary development.</rac_child_development_body>
