        <rac_child_development_body>Children have practiced comparing heights and lengths informally by sight and by nonstandard units. Learning to use a ruler is the next step! Although children are unlikely to correctly measure using a ruler, encourage them to practice lining up an object with the end of the ruler and noting what number it reaches.</rac_child_development_body>
