They learn that the labels assigned to different objects, such as the word for <ac_teacher-talk-emphasis>shoe</ac_teacher-talk-emphasis>, are arbitrary, and that any given object can be assigned more than one label.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider having children take off one of their shoes and have them line the shoes up according to size in an empty space. Have them measure the shoes with a ruler and see how many different sizes there are. Share children’s foot size with them by writing the number on a piece of paper. Then show children how shoes have different numbers to represent different sizes. </ac_teacher-card-body>

Was their decision based on the size of the object? Are there some big things that are not heavy? Are there some small things that are heavy? Which materials are heavy? Which is heavier, concrete or paper? Wood or cotton?</ac_teacher-card-body>
