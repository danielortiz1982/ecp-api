          <ac_teacher-card-body>The classroom is a great place to show children that the language they speak at home is valued and that they know things that others, including the teacher, may not know. Ask children if they know how to say the names of the animals in another language. Have them teach one animal name to you and the rest of the class.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Preschoolers may not produce all speech sounds correctly. If children mispronounce a word in a sentence, repeat the sentence after them, rather than correcting them explicitly. Emphasize the word as you repeat the sentence and ask the child to repeat it after you to help improve children’s speech. </ac_teacher-card-body>
