        <rac_child_development_body>In order to count a set of items, children need to know the number words in order, matching one number word to one item while counting, and be able to keep track of which items have been counted. When you count with children, keep a finger on each item as it is counted to demonstrate clearly how to count accurately.</rac_child_development_body>

          <rac_teacher-talk_blue>When you resist impulses, you are able to stop and think before you do something. You might want to eat a cookie without permission, but you know you will get in trouble if you do! You can stop and think of other ways to have fun instead.

        <rac_child_development_body>Practicing with location words not only develops spatial awareness, but also prepares children to follow directions later in life. In kindergarten classrooms, children are often told to put things under a table or stand behind a line. If children do not know directional language, misunderstandings can lead to perceived behavior issues.</rac_child_development_body>
