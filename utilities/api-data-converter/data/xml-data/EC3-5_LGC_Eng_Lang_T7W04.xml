        <rac_child_development_body>Children are innately curious about their world. Teaching science in the preschool classroom can help further that curiosity. One practice you can implement to encourage your students’ interest in science is to bring in objects from outside (for example, rocks and sticks) that the children can touch, smell, and otherwise examine.</rac_child_development_body>
