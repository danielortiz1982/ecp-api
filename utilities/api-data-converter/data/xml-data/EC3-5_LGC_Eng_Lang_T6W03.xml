As you read aloud, minimize distractions by reducing background noise and having children focus on your face as well as on the pages of the book you are reading.

        <rac_child_development_body>Children at this age are just beginning to be able to recognize pride in themselves. You can stimulate this emotion by pointing it out: “You did a great job! You must feel very happy and proud of yourself.” It is equally important to model pride; for example, by saying, “I am proud of the job we did cleaning up today!” (Terebush, 2017)</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>By age 4, children should be able to speak in understandable sentences. For children who lack articulation orwho mumble, try repeating clearly and crisply what they say, so that they hear how their words should sound. If children continue to respond in one- or two-word phrases, encourage them to add on, and model how to do so.</rac_child_development_body>
