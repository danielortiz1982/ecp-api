              <ac_teacher-speaking>In this activity, we will look at pictures and talk about what season they show. Then we find the label on the table and place the card under the correct season. Finally, we will write about each season.  </ac_teacher-speaking>   </ac_teacher-card-body>

Down, down, down he went! </ac_teacher-speaking>   </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Review the names of each season with multilingual learners before you begin the activity. Use sticky notes for each season and draw an object, such as a flower, and write the word as well. Ask children, “Where do I place this?” Encourage children to say the name of the season. Summer and winter may be easy, but children may need guidance for spring and fall. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Attention Support </ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>To keep distracted children on task, have them draw a symbol for each season on a paper circle (yellow sun for summer, snowflake for winter, rain cloud for spring, orange leaves for fall). Have them hold up the matching circle for each season as you present the picture cards. You might have children act out the activity on the card. </ac_teacher-card-body>
