          <ac_teacher-card-body>Write out the words and numbers for each froggie and practice saying the words aloud, using your fingers to demonstrate how many. Once children have practiced several times, say the number and have children select the puppet with the corresponding number.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage fine motor development by inviting children to use their stick puppets to demonstrate how the froggies jump on the bed. Using their fingers to hold the sticks and using their arms to imitate jumping helps children become aware of their own body in their own personal space.</ac_teacher-card-body>
