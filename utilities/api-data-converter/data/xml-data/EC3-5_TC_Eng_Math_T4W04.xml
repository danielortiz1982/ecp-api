              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Talk About Equal Groups</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Talk with children about what happens when you separate objects into equal groups. Help children notice that the numbers in each group are the same, or <ac_teacher-talk>equal</ac_teacher-talk>. Relate the concept to sharing and how a child might divide something equally, like a snack or some toys, with a friend.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider using larger or smaller manipulatives instead of Connecting Cubes to support children’s fine motor needs. Alternately, ask children to cut out shapes from green paper and use those as “frogs” in the activity.</ac_teacher-card-body>
