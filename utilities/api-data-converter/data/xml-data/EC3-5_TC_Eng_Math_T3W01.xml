          <ac_teacher-card-body>If children are having trouble with the names of the numbers during the extend portion, encourage them to say the name of the number in their home language. You can then repeat the number in English, and have them repeat it after you.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Use the Magnetic Numerals rather than the Number Cards, and encourage children to hold them in their hands and trace the shapes of them with their fingers to become more familiar with the forms of the numerals. Point out to children that this uses their sense of touch in addition to their sense of sound.</ac_teacher-card-body>
