          <ac_teacher-card-body>Begin the activity by reviewing position words such as <ac_teacher-talk>on, beside, next to, in front of, near, far,</ac_teacher-talk> and <ac_teacher-talk>behind</ac_teacher-talk> with two different colored Connecting Cubes. Use these manipulatives to model placement using location words.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Speech Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Explain that there is sometimes more than one location word that means the same thing. For example, you could say the blue Connecting Cube is <ac_teacher-talk>on top of </ac_teacher-talk>the red Connecting Cube, or that the red Connecting Cube is <ac_teacher-talk>under</ac_teacher-talk> the blue Connecting Cube. You could also describe two Connecting Cubes as being <ac_teacher-talk>near</ac_teacher-talk> each other or <ac_teacher-talk>close to</ac_teacher-talk> each other.</ac_teacher-card-body>
