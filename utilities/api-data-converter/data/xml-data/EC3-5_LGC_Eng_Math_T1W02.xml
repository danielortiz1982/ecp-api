        <rac_child_development_body>Preschoolers often experience their emotions physically. They clench their fists when angry or feel a knot in their stomach when sad. But they often don’t know yet how to label these feelings. Guide children to connect physical reactions with the feelings behind them by naming each feeling directly. Knowing what an emotion is can make it less scary to feel!</rac_child_development_body>
