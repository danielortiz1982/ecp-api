          <ac_teacher-card-body>To help children with auditory discrimination challenges, exaggerate the movements of your mouth as you form each letter sound, being mindful of your tongue and lip positions. Do this while saying the sound in isolation and again as you say the sound within the picture word. Invite children to move their mouths in the same way as they make the letter sounds.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Multilingual learners (like babies acquiring their first language) learn best through oral language experiences. Children who are immersed in rich language through read-aloud books and teacher and parent modeling will naturally learn to use the correct forms of verbs. There are some verb past tenses that even adults have to look up from time to time, but the most common past tenses will come naturally to children who are exposed to them on a regular basis.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>In this activity, preview the first card with children, making sure that children understand that they must respond in a complete sentence. Let children know that if they need help you will say the answer, and they will repeat it. Make the activity more engaging by asking children to repeat the sentence in a loud voice and then a soft voice.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Food is often tied to cultural identity, so you want to be careful not to criticize a particular food or method of food preparation that is important and familiar to your children. Rather, help children recognize foods that are high in sugar and unhealthy fats, and emphasize moderation. What is important is that children learn to make healthy food choices and recognize that they can limit unhealthy foods, including their daily intake of sugar and unhealthy fats.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Tell children that exercise is also an important part of being healthy. Explain that running and jumping are good for their hearts. Have children run and jump in place. Ask children why they need to make sure that they don’t spend all of their time watching television or playing games on the computer or on a tablet.</ac_teacher-card-body>
