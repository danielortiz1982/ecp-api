          <ac_teacher-card-body>This is a wonderful activity for multilingual learners. You can add the word in their home language on the page, so they are making multilingual books! When they are finished you may ask them if you can add their multilingual books to the class library. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Fine Motor Skills</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children without fine motor skills may have difficulty drawing pictures. You can support those children by providing outlines (such as a diamond shape for a kite), or stickers to illustrate their scenes. </ac_teacher-card-body>
