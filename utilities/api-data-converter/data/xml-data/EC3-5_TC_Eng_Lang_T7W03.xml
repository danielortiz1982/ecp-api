              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Explain the Activity</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  <ac_teacher-speaking>I’ll show you pictures that have two or more things in them. Then I’ll ask you to say how the two things are related, or connected. For example, I might show you a picture of a corn kernel and a corn cob. I’d ask,<ac_teacher-speaking_emphasis_blue> Which is bigger?</ac_teacher-speaking_emphasis_blue> You’d say, <ac_teacher-speaking_emphasis_blue>The corn cob is bigger than the corn kernel. </ac_teacher-speaking_emphasis_blue>Ready?  </ac_teacher-speaking>    </ac_teacher-card-body>

              <ac_teacher-speaking>Some of these words help us compare two things. When we compare, we can say how one thing is more, or less, than something else. Other words help us show how two things are related in space. We can say whether something was beside or on something else.</ac_teacher-speaking>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage multilingual learners to use a physical response to express the relationship between two objects. For example, set a small toy and an empty tissue box on the table. Let children place the toy inside, on, or next to the box.

          <ac_teacher-card-body>If children need attention support, allow all children to participate with each card. Show the card to the whole group, and ask the question on the back. Have students respond chorally to Support questions. Then give each child an opportunity to respond individually to the Extend question.</ac_teacher-card-body>
