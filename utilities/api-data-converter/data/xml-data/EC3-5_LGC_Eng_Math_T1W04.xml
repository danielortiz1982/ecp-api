        <rac_child_development_body>Preschoolers are still discovering the logic of the world. They may be able to count objects in one direction, but counting them in a different order can feel like a whole new task! Repetition is the key. Whenever you count a set of objects, repeat your count in at least one different order where children can clearly see your work.</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_body-text>Everyone has emotions. We can be happy or sad, scared or excited, or even surprised! For everyone, there are times when our feelings are stronger than we want them to be. When our emotions are too strong, we can find ways to calm down. We can close our eyes, breathe deeply, count quietly, or move somewhere quieter until we feel better. <rac_child_development_icon> </rac_child_development_icon>

        <rac_child_development_body>It’s important for children to help children manage their emotions. They need to feel their emotions fully and understand that they are real. But it’s equally important for them to be able to calm down. At first, children may need an adult’s help in finding ways to relax. Giving suggestions like getting a book to read or moving to a calm place is the first step in guiding children to develop independent strategies. (Diamond, 2013)</rac_child_development_body>
