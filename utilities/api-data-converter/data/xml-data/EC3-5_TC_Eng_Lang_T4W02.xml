          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to use a physical response, in addition to speaking. For example, invite children to move like the animal shown when the animal is real (e.g., hop like a rabbit or slither like a snake). These physical and visual cues will support language development, and children will be able to participate in the activity while their language skills grow.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Invite children to play this activity in the large-group space or outdoors where they can move their bodies like each animal would. This activity would give children the opportunity to hop like a rabbit and slither like a snake, etc. When children choose a card for an animal that is not real, they can take the pose of that animal and stay still for a moment. Using their whole bodies to play helps children to develop their memories and their strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to use a physical response, in addition to speaking. For example, invite children to use their hands to show something about the animal they are talking about (e.g., hold their hands around their face to indicate a lion’s mane, or fold a hand in front of their mouth to indicate a parrot’s beak). These physical and visual cues will support language development, and children will be able to participate in the activity while their language skills grow.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Invite children to play this activity in the large-group space or outdoors where they can move their bodies like each animal would. This activity would give them the opportunity to prowl like a lion, walk like a cat or a dog, and move their arms like bird wings, etc. Using their whole bodies to play helps children develop their memories and their strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>
