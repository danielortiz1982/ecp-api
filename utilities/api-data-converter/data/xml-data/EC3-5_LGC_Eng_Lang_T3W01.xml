        <rac_child_development_body>Introducing children to different words that describe how things taste, smell, look, sound, and feel is a great opportunity to expand their English vocabulary. Children might already know some concepts, like salty, in their home language, and simply need an English label. Concepts, such as bitter, may be new conceptually.</rac_child_development_body>
