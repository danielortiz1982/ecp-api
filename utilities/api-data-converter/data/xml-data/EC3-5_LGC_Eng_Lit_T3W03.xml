        <rac_child_development_body>Teaching children letter names is great, but teaching the sounds that letters represent is the first step in growing children’s pre-reading skills. During Circle Time activities, the teacher provides a word orally. This directs the child’s attention to the sound first. Only after the sound is identified is the connection to the letter made.</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Before children have the vocabulary to express their feelings, they do so through facial expressions, body language, and behaviors. Children need to be taught to put names to feelings before they can learn to self-regulate their reactions. Acknowledge the feelings first, and then model appropriate responses to them as opportunities arise. (Martinelli, n.d.)</rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Young children are engaged in measurement activities without even realizing it. “Fairness” is very important to preschoolers, so they’re acutely aware if someone else “got more” or “has a bigger piece.” When you overhear such conversations, build upon children’s understanding by asking, How do you know? How can we measure that?</rac_child_development_body>
