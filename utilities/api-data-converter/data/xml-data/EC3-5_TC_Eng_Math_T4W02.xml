Allow and encourage children to call the animals by more specific names, like parrot for the bird, or use alternate names, like bunny for rabbit, or similar animals, like guinea pig for hamster.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Have the children act out holding each of the animals from the cards. They can also act out the various care activities like feeding and bathing the pet. In addition to developing gross motor skills, this may also help children determine relative sizes.</ac_teacher-card-body>
