        <rac_child_development_body>Learning about shapes is the first way children begin to explore geometry. Young children observe that shapes can be combined and broken down to make new shapes (for example, two squares combine to become a rectangle). This helps them begin to see the relationship between two- and three-dimensional shapes. </rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Preschoolers are usually eager to follow daily routines. Most young children appreciate the structure of classroom rules because predictable rules and routines let them know what to expect throughout the day. Because they are so reliant on routines, children sometimes get frustrated or angry when an adult deviates from the routine. (Miller, Scholastic.com)</rac_child_development_body>
