          <ac_teacher-card-body>Extended conversation plays a critical role in helping multilingual learners to acquire a new language. One way to support children is by using oral conversation frames that repeat part of the question in the answer. For example: “What is teamwork? Teamwork is working together.” Have children say the frames with you. Then have partners use the frames to ask and answer questions with each other. </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Attention Support</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Many children who struggle with attention disorders can fall into a state of hyperfocus. If you have a child in your class who tends to do this, a project like this one may be daunting: they may resent having to move from their “shape” before they have completed it in order to move on. Trust your judgment in approaching transitions.</ac_teacher-card-body>
