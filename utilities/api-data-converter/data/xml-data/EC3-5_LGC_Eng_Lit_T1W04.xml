        <rac_child_development_body>Just as we teach children good manners, we must teach them good hygiene habits. Starting young helps build a foundation that will grow with children. Incorporating specific times to wash hands throughout the school day (before snack and lunch, after using the bathroom) will go far in preventing the spread of germs from child to child.</rac_child_development_body>

According to Patty O’Grady, PhD, the best way for children to learn to be kind is to feel it themselves. Benefits of teaching kindness in school: increased peer acceptance, sense of belonging, improved self-esteem. </rac_child_development_body>

Instead teach conflict-resolution strategies: Use a calm voice, listen to all sides, encourage children to suggest solutions and choose one to try out. Discuss differences in outcome based on the solution chosen.</rac_child_development_body>
