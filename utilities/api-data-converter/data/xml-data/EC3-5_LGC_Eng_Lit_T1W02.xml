        <rac_child_development_hed-green>Child Development: Asking for Help</rac_child_development_hed-green>
        <rac_child_development_body>Your classroom should be a place where children feel safe and comfortable asking for help. Children need to know how to ask for help—not every time a task is hard, but definitely before they feel frustrated to continue. Model requests: “I want to do this, but I need help, please” or “Can you explain this, please?”. (Kennedy-Moore, 2018.) </rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_child_development_body>Children at this age are just learning to apply language to their feelings. If they are unable to articulate how they feel, it may result in a classroom meltdown. You can help them develop emotional vocabulary by noticing and naming their feelings and by encouraging them to express their emotions in words.

        <rac_child_development_body>Reading body language is an important skill. Children need to understand that people use their bodies to convey emotions. Model positive body language—stand up tall, make eye contact, and avoid folding your arms. “Read” children’s body language aloud: “I can tell that you are excited; you’re waving your hand.” (Ruland, 2018)</rac_child_development_body> </section-block>

        <rac_child_development_body>Most very young children can easily discern expressions of fear and happiness on others. Other emotions may be harder to recognize, but as children mature, they become better able to distinguish between expressions. Impairment in facial expression recognition is often a marker for autism spectrum disorder. (Rodger et al, 2015; Loth et al, 2018) </rac_child_development_body>
