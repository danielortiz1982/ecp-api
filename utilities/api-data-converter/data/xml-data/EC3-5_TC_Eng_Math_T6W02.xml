              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Play</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Guide children to build patterns for their partners. Then, have them switch roles so that the child who was previously building a pattern is now extending the pattern.</ac_teacher-card-body>

              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Extend</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Once all children have made and extended patterns, remind children of how to create rhymes. Say an ABAB pattern with words or sounds, such as <ac_teacher-talk>head, chair, thread, bear</ac_teacher-talk>. (Don’t worry about it making sense.) Continue the pattern, like <ac_teacher-talk>fed, air, shed</ac_teacher-talk>, and then pause for the group to fill in a new word that rhymes. Repeat with other patterns.</ac_teacher-card-body>
