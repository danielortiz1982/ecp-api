If children are having difficulty manipulating the cubes, give them a tray or work mat and allow them to place their cubes in a row without connecting them.

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who need language support, limit the body parts and motions to a distinct set. Review these terms before beginning to play. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who have difficulty doing full-body movements, modify the directions so they rely less on coordination and balance and more on an understanding of location words. Allow children to sit as they play and limit the moves to moving hands and arms only.</ac_teacher-card-body>
