        <rac_child_development_body>Most communication is nonverbal. Exaggerating nonverbal cues as you teach vocabulary is a way to help multilingual learners. For example, when you teach heavy, weigh your arms down and sag as you say the word. As you discuss which items are heavy, repeat these nonverbal cues.</rac_child_development_body>
