        <rac_child_development_body>When children begin to explore the relationship between rhyming words, they are engaging with “onset and rime.” Onset is any sound that comes before the vowel in a word and rime is the sound of the rest of the word. Playing rhyming games helps children further develop this skill which makes them stronger readers. </rac_child_development_body>
