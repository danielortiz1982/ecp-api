        <rac_child_development_body>Frustration is a big part of learning. When children become overwhelmed with frustration, give them a minute to cool off and then ask questions that will help them discover a solution on their own. Helping them create their own solution instead of giving one to them will help boost their self-confidence.</rac_child_development_body>
