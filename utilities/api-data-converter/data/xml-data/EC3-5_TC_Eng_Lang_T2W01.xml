          <ac_teacher-card-body>Preschoolers need to learn how to sustain attention during classroom activities. You can encourage paying attention by repeating the questions on each card and asking children to repeat the question. Improving children’s receptive vocabulary (listening comprehension) will help them sustain attention. Try to increase children’s vocabulary each week, using new vocabulary every day and providing safe opportunities to use those words on their own.  </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>The classroom is a great place to show children that the language they speak at home is valued, and that they know something that others, including the teacher, may not know. Ask children if they know how to say any of the activities they see in the pictures in another language. Have them teach one expression to you and the rest of the class.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Focus Attention</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Helping children focus their attention is a critical learning milestone for preschoolers. You can help children focus their attention through a variety of strategies, including using simple directions and previewing each activity before you begin. Model what to do with each card and check to make sure that all children know what to do.  </ac_teacher-card-body>
