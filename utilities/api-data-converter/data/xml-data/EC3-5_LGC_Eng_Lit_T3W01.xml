The rate at which children learn their ABCs varies, but exposure to print is key. To encourage letter recognition, point out and name letters in the room around you and label children’s desks and cubbies with names. </rac_child_development_body>

These connections are crucial in strengthening children’s abilities to process and respond to sensory stimulation. Note that our skin is used for touching.  </rac_child_development_body>
