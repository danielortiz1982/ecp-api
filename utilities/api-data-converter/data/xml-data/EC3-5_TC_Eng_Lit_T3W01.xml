For example: After a child answers that <ac_teacher-talk>kite </ac_teacher-talk>begins with /k/, say “Yes, <ac_teacher-talk>kite </ac_teacher-talk>begins with the sound /k/.” Hold up a<ac_teacher-talk> K</ac_teacher-talk> letter card and say “/k/ is the sound of the letter <ac_teacher-talk>Kk</ac_teacher-talk>.” </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>To help children with auditory discrimination challenges, exaggerate the movements of your mouth as you form each letter sound, being mindful of your tongue and lip positions. Do this while saying the sound in isolation and again as you say the sound within the picture word. Invite children to move their mouths in the same way as they make the letter sound.</ac_teacher-card-body>
