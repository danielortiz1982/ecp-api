        <rac_child_development_body>Children of this age need to develop persistence rather than give up on a challenging task. Teachers of children in this age group have an important role in developing this skill, which is helpful both now and later in all areas of life. Praising effort, providing challenges, and offering guidance all help children master this ability. (Young and Reed, 2017)</rac_child_development_body>
