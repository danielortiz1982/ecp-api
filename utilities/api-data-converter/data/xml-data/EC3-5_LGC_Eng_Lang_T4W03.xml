Then explain that when you say “green light,” children can move around like the animals they have chosen and move toward a finish line. But when you say “red light” they must stop. If children move when you say “red light” they must go back to the starting line. The first child to reach the finish line will be the one to say “red light, green light” during the next round. Remind children that there is no running. Ensure that the area is clear before children start the game. </rac_body-text>
