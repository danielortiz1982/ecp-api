          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider using larger manipulatives, such as colored blocks rather than the Pattern Blocks, to support the fine motor needs of the children in each group.

We will discuss where we want to plant each vegetable, and I will plant it on our paper. I might make a mistake though! If I make a mistake, raise your hand to let me know.</ac_teacher-speaking>    </ac_teacher-card-body>
