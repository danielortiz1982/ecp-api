          <ac_teacher-card-body>Allow children to respond to the questions with a physical response. For example, if a picture card shows a shelter, they might crouch down and cover their heads with their arms. If it does not show a shelter, they might spread their arms wide open. Physical and visual clues like these can help language learners participate in small-group activities as their language skills develop. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>After finishing the activity, consider having children make their own physical representations of the shelters depicted on the picture  cards. For example, they might make a bird nest out of found materials or dig a fox den in a sandbox.</ac_teacher-card-body>
