          <ac_teacher-card-body>Model and encourage children to use a physical response, in addition to speaking, to talk about whether the pictures show something that tastes sweet or sour. For example, children can shake their heads and stick their tongues out in disgust to show that something tastes bad. Or, smile and pat their stomachs to show that something tastes good. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Offer children the option to draw a response to the activity using pencils, crayons, or markers. Be sure to provide colors that match the foods shown on the cards (e.g., green, red, white, etc.). Encourage children to talk as they draw, using as many describing words as possible.</ac_teacher-card-body>
