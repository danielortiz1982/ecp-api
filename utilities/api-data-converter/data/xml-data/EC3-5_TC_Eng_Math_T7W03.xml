              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Compare</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Once children have built their beanstalks as high as possible, invite them to place their beanstalks side by side to compare. <ac_teacher-speaking>Which beanstalk is the tallest? Which is the shortest?</ac_teacher-speaking> Guide children to count the number of Connecting Cubes in each beanstalk to discuss height. For example, <ac_teacher-speaking>This beanstalk is six Connecting Cubes tall. This one is 10. It is taller.</ac_teacher-speaking>     </ac_teacher-card-body>
