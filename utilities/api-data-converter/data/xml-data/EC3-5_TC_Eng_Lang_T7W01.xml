Remind them to take turns speaking, with one person actively listening while the other speaks.

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider doing this activity in the large-group space or outdoors, where children can really show off newly achieved gross-motor milestones. This activity would give them the opportunity to show how they can pedal a tricycle, pump on a swing, or go across the monkey bars. Big body play encourages engagement, activates memory, and helps develop children’s strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage multilingual learners in your class to share the sounds that people make when they snore or the sounds that each animal shown in a card makes when it is awake and active. Children will enjoy learning that animals around the world “speak” different languages.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Gross Motor Development</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage children to act out activities they see on each card as they also describe them in words. Let children curl up and snore or pretend to fly through the air like an owl. Big body play encourages engagement and activates memory. It also helps develop children’s strength and coordination.</ac_teacher-card-body>
