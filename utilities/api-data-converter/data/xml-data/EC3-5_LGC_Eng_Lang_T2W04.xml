        <rac_child_development_body>Learning to deal with disappointment helps children develop coping skills and emotional resilience. You can help children by labeling your own emotions (e.g., when you feel frustrated or tired) and by helping children identify and describe their own emotions. Teach children to take deep breaths when they are feeling sad or disappointed. </rac_child_development_body>
