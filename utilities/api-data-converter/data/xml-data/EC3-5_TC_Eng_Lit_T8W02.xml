Talk to children about self-awareness and self-regulation, and explain that it extends to recognizing our feelings. Make faces to show emotions: happy, sad, mad, or scared. Ask children to identify the feeling. When they answer, ask them to name a time when they felt that emotion. If time permits, talk about how they react to these feelings. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Be aware that multilingual learners may be thinking of the alphabet in their first language instead of the English alphabet. Before you start the race, have children sing the alphabet song together. Ensure all children have a clear understanding of the English alphabet before starting the race. </ac_teacher-card-body>
