Then, ask a child to count the remaining four counters.

Each time, ask children to tell you how many racers are left, and ask two more children to count them. As each racer crosses the finish line, ask children to say how many racers have finished and how many haven’t raced yet.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>If space allows, have children act as the counters. Select children to “race” to a designated finish line across the room or outside, and have children say and count how many children have already raced and how many have not yet. You may also place the counters on a longer table or on the floor, and encourage children to walk with the counter over to the designated finish line.</ac_teacher-card-body>
