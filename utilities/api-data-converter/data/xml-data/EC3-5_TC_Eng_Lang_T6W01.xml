          <ac_teacher-card-body>Young children are usually better at learning a new language than adults. Adults may be afraid that they will say something incorrectly in English. On the other hand, young children are less inhibited and willing to take risks. Create a stress-free environment in which children enjoy trying out new words and phrases, one where their home language and English are both celebrated.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider doing this activity in a large-group space, where children can listen to music and act out each word. This activity would give them the opportunity to move their bodies to demonstrate the meaning of the word. Whole-body movement activates memory and listening, and helps children develop strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Consider having children act out the scenes in a large space, such as the playground. This activity would give them the opportunity to move their bodies to demonstrate how the animal might move or sound. Whole-body movement activates memory and listening, and helps children develop strength.</ac_teacher-card-body>
