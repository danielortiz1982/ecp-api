When they come back inside, have them draw a picture that shows the weather they saw, using symbols, letters, or drawings. Tell them to decide on what words they would like to use to finish the sentence “The weather today is <fill-in-the-blank>             </fill-in-the-blank>.” Help transcribe children’s sentences.     </ac_teacher-card-body>

What did they see? What did they feel? Discuss ideas for other outdoor things to observe, such as the trees and leaves. To continue the activity, you can create detailed Daily Weather books.  </ac_teacher-card-body>

During their weather observations, help children notice even the smallest details, encouraging them to talk about everything they see, hear, smell, and feel. Remember that science always begin with curiosity and wonder! </ac_teacher-card-body>
