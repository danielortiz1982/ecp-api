Once a child names an example, hand the child a paper towel “ticket.” Provide support by asking questions that will help children name scenarios on their own. Once every child has a paper towel “ticket,” review the Big Chart and the steps for washing hands. Children will then wash their hands, one at a time, while singing “The Alphabet Song.”</ac_teacher-card-body>

Say the number of each step so they remember that there are five. Remind them to sing the “The Alphabet Song” aloud or to themselves as they wash.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For multilingual learners, repeat the steps for handwashing multiple times. Then have the children act out each step with you and talk about each one. Above the classroom sink, display a poster with each of the steps for handwashing, using numbers to indicate the steps.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>For children who may struggle with holding a bar of soap and scrubbing their hands, provide liquid soap. Remind children to think about this week’s Mind Builder and respecting each other’s personal boundaries by getting soap and water only on themselves.</ac_teacher-card-body>
