          <rac_body-text>Reinforce the concept of persisting in solving problems by having children work with partners to plan something they want to build. Use age-appropriate materials such as log cabin toy sets, interlocking bricks, or sticky foam beads. As children build, encourage them to share their ideas, use persistence, and try to complete their building. Ask children whether working together to build something made it easier and more fun.</rac_body-text>

        <rac_child_development_body>In the preK classroom, persisting in attempting to solve problems can happen anytime and anywhere. Explicit and direct role-playing serves as skill-building before problems occur. One of the best ways to teach emotional and executive function skills is by role-playing, which provides an authentic scenario in a safe space. (Thomas and Thorne, 2009) </rac_child_development_body>
