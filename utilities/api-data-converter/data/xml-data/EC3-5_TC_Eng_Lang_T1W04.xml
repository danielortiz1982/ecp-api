              <ac_teacher-speaking>One way to find new friends is to find people who like the same things that you do. In this activity, we’re going to look at pictures of different activities we do at school. We will find out who in our group likes the same thing. Everyone who likes what is on that card will move to the center of the circle. Then we’ll pick another card. This is a fun activity that will help us learn more about each other and find friends we can play with during the school day.</ac_teacher-speaking>
