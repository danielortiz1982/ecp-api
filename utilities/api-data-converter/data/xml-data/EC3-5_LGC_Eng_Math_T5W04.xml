        <rac_child_development_body>Safety drills can be worrying for many children. Help children cope by providing context (fires rarely happen) and showing patterns of behavior (practicing fire drills). Role-playing situations, like fire drills, give children situational context and shows them what to expect. It can also help to explain the unlikeliness of a real emergency.</rac_child_development_body>
