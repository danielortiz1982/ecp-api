These children may be tired, but they may also need input for their sensory system. If children have trouble sitting still or listening during lessons, you might want to try distributing hand fidgets or other manipulatives such as a stress ball or bouncy bands. Set fidget rules for the classroom.</ac_teacher-card-body>

By age three, familiar people should understand what children are saying, and by age four most people should understand a child’s speech. Provide safe opportunities for children to practice sounds in different words and longer sentences.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Humans learn the grammar of language through oral language models. Subject-verb agreement is an abstract concept even for older children. It helps to lay a good foundation for children to learn the grammar of academic language during these early years.  If a child says something incorrectly, such as “They was singing,” respond by repeating the statement correctly, such as “Yes. They were singing.” </ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Sensory Support</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>Create a sensory-friendly classroom by providing accommodations for children who have difficulty remaining still during activities that require attention without movement. You may have children stand after each question and raise both hands, clap their hands, or some other movement to help them “take a break” between cards.</ac_teacher-card-body>
