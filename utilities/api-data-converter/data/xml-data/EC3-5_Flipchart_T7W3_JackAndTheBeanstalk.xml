            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack who lived with his mother. They lived in a little house.  </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“Jack,” said his mother. “Please take our old cow to the market and sell it. Then we will have gold coins to buy things.”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>On his way to the market, Jack met an old man. “I will trade you a handful of beans for your cow,” said the old man.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“Our cow is worth much more than a handful of beans,” said Jack.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“But these are magic beans,” said the old man.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack was very curious about the magic beans. So <flip_chart-bold>Jack traded their cow for the beans.</flip_chart-bold></flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>When he told his mother about the magic beans, she said, “That was a very foolish thing to do.” Then she tossed the beans out the window.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack went out and watered the magic beans. He wanted them to grow. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>That night, while Jack was asleep, one little bean started to grow. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The next morning, the little bean plant got plenty of sunlight. Jack kept two hungry rabbits away from the bean plant. He watered the bean plant again.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The little plant grew and grew and grew. It grew all the way up to the clouds. Jack looked up at the giant beanstalk. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack was very curious about the giant beanstalk. So he grabbed hold of it and began to climb it. <flip_chart-bold>Jack climbed and climbed.</flip_chart-bold> Soon he was above the clouds.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The first thing he saw was a huge house. He looked in and saw a huge table and huge chairs.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>A giant and his wife stormed in. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“Fee Fie Fo Fum! I think there is someone in our house,” said the giant.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“Nonsense, dear husband!” said his wife.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“There is no one here but you, and me, and our wonderful goose. Be kind to our goose that lays the golden eggs for us,” she said.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>But the giant didn’t listen. He yelled at the goose.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>“Goose!” commanded the mean giant. “Lay a golden egg now!”</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>And the sad goose laid an egg made of pure gold.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack felt sorry for the sad goose. He wanted to save the goose from the mean giant. So while the giants were busy eating dinner, <flip_chart-bold>Jack saved the goose.</flip_chart-bold></flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack grabbed the goose and ran to the beanstalk. Then he began to climb down. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
              <flip_chart-bold>Down, down, down Jack went.</flip_chart-bold> </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Just then, the giants saw the beanstalk move. They rushed to the beanstalk. They looked down from above the clouds and saw Jack.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Jack reached the ground quickly. Then he chopped down the beanstalk as fast as he could. Now the giant could not be mean to the goose anymore.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>From that day on, the goose laid eggs of gold for Jack and his mother. And they lived happily ever after.  </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
