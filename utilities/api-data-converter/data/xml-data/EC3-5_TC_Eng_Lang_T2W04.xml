          <ac_teacher-card-body>Allow children to respond to the questions with a physical response. For example, if a picture card shows a person going down on a seesaw, they might crouch down and sit on the floor. If it shows a person going up on a seesaw, they might stand up on their toes. Physical and visual clues like these can help language learners participate in small-group activities as their language skills develop. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Some children may have difficulty identifying perspectives. If so, have children try acting out the perspective. For example, have two children stand apart from one another and have one child hold a ball. Ask children to identify the child that is closer to the ball and then the child that is farther away from the ball.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Check multilingual learners’ knowledge of the names for an ambulance, a helicopter, a canoe, and a train. Some Spanish speakers may use the same word (barco) for a canoe, a ship, and a boat. Show children pictures of canoes, ships, and boats to differentiate the vehicles. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Discuss different objects that have volume control such as a television or a car radio.  Explain that when we quiet down, we turn down our volume. Have children make the sound of a siren in a loud voice and then a quiet voice. Talk about times when it is okay to speak loudly and when it is important to turn down the volume and speak in a quiet voice. Encourage children to use the word <ac_teacher-talk-emphasis>volume</ac_teacher-talk-emphasis> to discuss how they make their voices louder and quieter.</ac_teacher-card-body>
