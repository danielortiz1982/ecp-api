          <ac_teacher-card-body>Give each child a set of 10 Connecting Cubes and have them work with their backs to each other before comparing, if necessary. Working with their own materials independently can help children organize their thoughts and workspace, increasing their attention to detail.</ac_teacher-card-body>
