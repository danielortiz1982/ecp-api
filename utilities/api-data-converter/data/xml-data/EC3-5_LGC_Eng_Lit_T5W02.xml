        <rac_child_development_body>Emergent writing is a child’s first attempt at writing. Children as young as two years old can imitate writing by drawing and making markings that represent thoughts. This is the beginning of the stages children progress through as they learn to write. This is an important predictor of children’s reading and writing skills.</rac_child_development_body>

Children who are multilingual are often learning two languages at once. They might only know certain words in one language.
