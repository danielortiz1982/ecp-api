            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Feet are amazing. They’re good for running, swimming, digging, climbing, grabbing, jumping, and more!</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head><flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Snail Foot</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>A snail is an animal with no legs but one foot! The soft, wet surface of the snail’s body is called its foot. It uses wavy motions to move along the ground. The foot is very sticky, which means the snail can even walk upside down on a ceiling!</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Duck Feet</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Ducks are excellent swimmers, thanks to their fantastic feet. They have webbed toes, which means their feet work like paddles when they swim. Ducks can’t feel their feet, so their paddlers never get cold!</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Ostrich Feet</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>The ostrich is the largest bird in the world. It’s the only bird that has just two toes on its feet. Those two toes are very strong and help this large bird run as fast as a car. This bird cannot fly, so it relies on its fantastic feet to run fast and to kick hard when there’s danger.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Gecko Feet</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Gecko feet are similar to the feet of spiders and insects. They have tiny folds on each foot, each with tiny hairs that have even more tiny hairs on them. All of this adds up to very grippy feet that can easily climb walls and glass.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Cat Feet</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Cats walk directly on their toes, which helps them move quickly and quietly. Unlike dogs, their footprints don’t show any claw marks because their claws are usually hidden inside the skin and fur on their feet. They stick their claws out when needed for climbing or hunting.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>Horse Feet</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>
            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Horses have one toe on each foot—and their toenail is called the hoof! That’s right, a horse hoof is made of the same material as our fingernails and toenails. The hoof is always growing and always being worn down as the horse walks and runs. </flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>
