            <flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>I love to go fast. But I can’t always go as fast as I want. My legs don’t move as well as other kids’ do. Leg braces help keep my legs strong.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>I look for sports where I can race and go fast. When I heard about wheelchair racing, I knew I had to try it. I needed a few things to start wheelchair racing. First, I needed a racing wheelchair. It is different from a regular wheelchair. Next, I needed to learn how to race. My coaches trained me. They taught me how to do it.</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Now, I love to race! I’m not an expert yet. I am always learning and getting better. Here’s how I get ready for a race:</flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph><flip_chart-teacher-facing-head>I Stretch</flip_chart-teacher-facing-head><flip_chart-teacher-facing-paragraph>Wheelchair racing is hard. I stretch before I race.
