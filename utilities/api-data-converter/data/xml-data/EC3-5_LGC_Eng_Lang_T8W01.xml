          <rac_body-text>Have children practice working together with their peers to play “Animal Sounds.” Have each child choose to be a different animal and then make the sound the animal makes. The goal is to  have children show that they know the sound each animal makes. Suggest animals for children who have a hard time thinking of animals to be. Make sure children know the sound we use in English for a dog and a cat. Each language uses its own sounds for animal sounds. For  example, in English the rooster says <rac_body-text_emphasis>cock-a-doodle-doo</rac_body-text_emphasis>. In Spanish he says <rac_body-text_emphasis>ququiriqui,</rac_body-text_emphasis> and in French he says <rac_body-text_emphasis>cocorico</rac_body-text_emphasis>. </rac_body-text>
