        <rac_child_development_body>Preschoolers understand that lengths and sizes of objects vary and can be compared. Children start by informally comparing the length, height, and size of objects and people around them. Help children develop this skill by using measurement vocabulary and asking children to measure using non-standard units of measurement. </rac_child_development_body>

        <rac_body-text>Thinking symbolically is tough for preschoolers, but we can help by explaining that symbols mean using one thing to stand for something else. When reading, we can use stuffed animals or puppets to represent characters. In math, numbers or blocks can represent how many.
