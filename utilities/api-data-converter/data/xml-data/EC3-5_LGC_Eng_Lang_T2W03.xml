        <rac_child_development_body>One of the key predictors of children’s academic achievement is their vocabulary. Developing children’s knowledge of sophisticated words in preschool is critical to a child’s success in school and in life. Children love learning “big words.” Using words like delectable, scrumptious, and exclaimed will build a strong foundation for life.</rac_child_development_body>
