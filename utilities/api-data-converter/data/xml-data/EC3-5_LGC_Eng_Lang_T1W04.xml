        <rac_child_development_body>Initiating and joining in play are key social development skills for young children. While playing, children learn important skills that they will continue to use for the rest of their lives: problem-solving, creativity, and a willingness to take risks, among others. Helping children learn the language for initiating and joining in play sets them up for success (Pathways.org/six stages).</rac_child_development_body>
