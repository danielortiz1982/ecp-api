          <ac_teacher-card-body>Multilingual learners may be hesitant to sing the song or not be familiar with the song. Take time before the activity to teach the song, so children can feel comfortable joining in as each new verse is added. </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children with fine motor developmental issues may struggle to pick cards from a pile. However, allowing children the time they need to pick up and hold the cards themselves can help them develop hand-eye coordination and finger dexterity. </ac_teacher-card-body>
