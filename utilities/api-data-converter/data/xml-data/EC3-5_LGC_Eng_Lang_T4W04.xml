        <rac_child_development_body>Learning new vocabulary words is key to a preschool child’s academic preparation for kindergarten. Children’s vocabulary grows significantly when vocabulary instruction is introduced in read aloud books.

        <rac_child_development_body>Flexible thinking involves thinking about something in a different way and taking a different approach to a task or a problem. It plays an important role in problem-solving. Encourage flexible thinking by playing silly rhyming or pun games, inviting children to suggest different uses for everyday objects, or making a new game by changing the rules of a popular game.
