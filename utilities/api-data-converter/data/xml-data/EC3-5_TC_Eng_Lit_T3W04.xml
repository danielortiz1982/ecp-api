          <ac_teacher-card-body>Encourage multilingual learners to practice naming the different paint colors in English as they make their color choices. If they use their native language, acknowledge it and then say the color name in English while pointing to the label on the paint cup.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>If children find holding and blowing through a straw too difficult, you can cut straws to provide shorter-lengths, or allow children to simply blow across the paper without using a straw. If you have access to a small, hand-held fan, children can also use the force of the fan to push the paint across their papers. Encourage them to adjust fan speeds and to notice the different effects on where the paint travels on the paper.</ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Children who have difficulty drawing, especially on such a large scale, may find it helpful for you to draw the outline of the object they decided to draw. Then children can add the colors and the details to their drawings. If children still have difficult writing their names, watch them as they write and have them practice the letter(s) that are most challenging for them.</ac_teacher-card-body>
