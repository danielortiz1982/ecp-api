Find a hexagon and move it far from the pile. You’ll need a lot of space to build!</ac_teacher-speaking> Guide children to find one hexagon and pull it far from the pile. <ac_teacher-speaking>Now, put another hexagon next to it. These will be our wheels!</ac_teacher-speaking></ac_teacher-card-body>

              <ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>Build</ac_teacher-card_run-in_hed>  Guide children to build a vehicle step-by-step, directing them to place Pattern Blocks using location words. For example: <ac_teacher-speaking>Place four squares above the wheels. These are the body of our car! Place one triangle on top of the squares. That will be our window. Now, put three diamonds in front of the car as our road.</ac_teacher-speaking></ac_teacher-card-body>
