          <ac_teacher-card-body>Spanish-speaking children will likely know three sounds for the letter x: /ks/ as in “examen”; /h/ as in “Mexico”; and /ch/ as in “Xela,” a city in Guatemala. Remind children that we are studying the sound /ks/, which is the most common sound of the letter in the English language.</ac_teacher-card-body>
          <ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>Auditory Discrimination</ac_mod_teacher-card_d_hed>
          <ac_teacher-card-body>To help children with auditory discrimination challenges, exaggerate the movements of your mouth as you form each letter sound. Ask children to notice the way your lips form an <ac_teacher-talk>o</ac_teacher-talk> for the /w/ sound, while your lips form nearly a straight line and your teeth show a bit to form the /ks/ position. Invite children to move their mouths the same way as they make the letter sound. As they practice, have them listen for the sound.</ac_teacher-card-body>

For example, the Spanish words for pond may be <ac_teacher-talk>estanque, la charka, </ac_teacher-talk>or<ac_teacher-talk> la balsa</ac_teacher-talk>. Have them use two or three words in English to describe an animal, as classmates try to guess which animal it is.  </ac_teacher-card-body>

          <ac_teacher-card-body>Invite children to make the sounds of different animals that live at the pond: a croaking frog, a chirping bird, a butterfly flapping its wings, a rabbit nibbling grass, a grasshopper rubbing its legs together, and so on. If classmates have a hard time guessing the animal based on its sound, encourage the child to act out the animal’s movements.</ac_teacher-card-body>
